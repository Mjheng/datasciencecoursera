1."subject": Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 			Its range is from 1 to 30.                           2."activity": WALKING  WALKING_UPSTAIRS  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  SITTING  STANDING  LAYING                        The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAcc-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccJerkMag, frequencyBodyGyroMag, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'frequency' to indicate frequency domain signals). These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.3."timeBodyAccMean-X"               4."timeBodyAccMean-Y"                5."timeBodyAccMean-Z"                6."timeBodyAccStd-X"                7."timeBodyAccStd-Y"                 8."timeBodyAccStd-Z"                 9."timeGravityAccMean-X"            10."timeGravityAccMean-Y"             11."timeGravityAccMean-Z"             12."timeGravityAccStd-X"             13."timeGravityAccStd-Y"              14."timeGravityAccStd-Z"              15."timeBodyAccJerkMean-X" 16."timeBodyAccJerkMean-Y"            17."timeBodyAccJerkMean-Z"            18."timeBodyAccJerkStd-X"            19."timeBodyAccJerkStd-Y"             20."timeBodyAccJerkStd-Z"             21."timeBodyGyroMean-X"              22."timeBodyGyroMean-Y"               23."timeBodyGyroMean-Z"               24."timeBodyGyroStd-X"               25."timeBodyGyroStd-Y"                26."timeBodyGyroStd-Z"                27."timeBodyGyroJerkMean-X"          28."timeBodyGyroJerkMean-Y"           29."timeBodyGyroJerkMean-Z"           30."timeBodyGyroJerkStd-X"           31."timeBodyGyroJerkStd-Y"            32."timeBodyGyroJerkStd-Z"            33."timeBodyAccMagMean"              34."timeBodyAccMagStd"                35."timeGravityAccMagMean"            36."timeGravityAccMagStd"            37."timeBodyAccJerkMagMean"           38."timeBodyAccJerkMagStd"            39."timeBodyGyroMagMean"             40."timeBodyGyroMagStd"               41."timeBodyGyroJerkMagMean"          42."timeBodyGyroJerkMagStd"          43."frequenceBodyAccMean-X"           44."frequenceBodyAccMean-Y"           45."frequenceBodyAccMean-Z"          46."frequenceBodyAccStd-X"            47."frequenceBodyAccStd-Y"            48."frequenceBodyAccStd-Z"           49."frequenceBodyAccJerkMean-X"      50."frequenceBodyAccJerkMean-Y"      51."frequenceBodyAccJerkMean-Z"      52."frequenceBodyAccJerkStd-X"        53."frequenceBodyAccJerkStd-Y"        54."frequenceBodyAccJerkStd-Z"       55."frequenceBodyGyroMean-X"          56."frequenceBodyGyroMean-Y"          57."frequenceBodyGyroMean-Z"         58."frequenceBodyGyroStd-X"           59."frequenceBodyGyroStd-Y"           60."frequenceBodyGyroStd-Z"          61."frequenceBodyAccMagMean"          62."frequenceBodyAccMagStd"          63."frequenceBodyBodyAccJerkMagMean" 64."frequenceBodyBodyAccJerkMagStd"65."frequenceBodyBodyGyroMagMean"66."frequenceBodyBodyGyroMagStd"     67."frequenceBodyBodyGyroJerkMagMean"68."frequenceBodyBodyGyroJerkMagStd"
